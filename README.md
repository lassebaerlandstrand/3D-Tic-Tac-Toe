## Description

A Unity project where Tic-Tac-toe is extended into 3 dimensions. The grid size can be any cube between 2x2x2 and 25x25x25. 

This project is made with the classic combination of Unity and C#. The total line of self written code adds up to 1900, which are divided into 29 unique scripts. The game is implemented into [my personal website](https://lasseprojects.netlify.app/3d%20tic%20tac%20toe/3dtictactoe) via WebGL.
