# 3D-Tic-Tac-Toe

### A Unity project made in 2022 where I created the classic game Tic-Tac-Toe in 3D.

### You can try out the project on [my personal website](https://lasseprojects.tech/3d-tic-tac-toe/3dtictactoe).

## Description

This Unity project is an extension of Tic-Tac-Toe into 3 dimensions. The game board consists of a cube, and the grid size can be set to any cube size between 2x2x2 and 25x25x25. This project is made with the classic combination of Unity and C#. The total lines of self written code adds up to 1900, which are divided into 32 unique scripts.

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow the steps below:

### Prerequisites
* Unity 2020.3
* (Optional) A web browser that supports WebGL to play the game (alternatively you can build it to another platform).

### Installation
1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/lassebaerlandstrand/3D-Tic-Tac-Toe.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Unity
3. Once the project is open, select the `Menu` scene in the [`Scenes` folder](Assets/Scenes/)
4. Press the play button in the top middle of the screen to play the game in the Unity editor
5. (Optional) To build the game to another platform, go to `File` -> `Build Settings` and select the platform you want to build to. Then press `Build and Run` to build the game to the selected platform.

### How to play
* Choose the grid size you want to play with, then press "Start"
* This game is played locally, so both players have to be on the same computer. Player 1 is the "X" player, and player 2 is the "O" player.
* The game is played by left clicking on the cube you want to place your mark on. The player who gets one of their marks in a row, column or diagonal wins the game.
* The cube is rotated by holding down the right mouse button and moving the mouse.
* If you want to select a cube which is not the outer layer, you can change the layer with the slider in the bottom left corner.
